# Conclusion

## Responses to business questions

1.  Member riders use more frequently than casual riders. Casual riders uses more longer time than member riders.

2.  Member riders use the bike-share service frequently through a week and a daytime.

3.  Frequent users could become members. Cyclistic can create the promotional campaign on the digital media for the casual users who use the bike-share service 3 days a week or 10 days a month. In addition, the campaign can be released before April according to the visualization.

## Recommendations

In order to maximize the annual members of the bike-share service of Cyclistic, the following three recommendations will help for a new marketing strategy.

1.  Increasing the stations at the business, school, and shopping areas to make frequent habits of casual riders by using the service.

2.  Place digital promotional campaigns before April to convert casual riders to annual membership users. According to the visualization with 5.1. many casual riders use the service during warm months.

3.  Notify or suggest the annual service plan for the casual riders who use the service 10 days a month.

Having implementation of these recommendations, we hope Cyclistic achieve their business task as soon as possible and contribute to the Eco-society.
